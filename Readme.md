The GUI will include features such as hand brightness and sound control, allowing users to adjust the brightness of their screen and control the volume of their device using hand gestures. The system will also feature a voice assistant, enabling users to control the GUI and other applications using voice commands. Additionally, the GUI will include a price comparison engine, allowing users to compare prices of products across multiple websites.
